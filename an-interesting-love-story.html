                    <p class="card-text prep">He liked to think sometimes he was a princess in a tower.

He had it, the tower, he had a whole damn castle!

His dad left it to him: Inheritance, you sometimes do not know what to do with it!

But he liked his castle, tough it was lost in the sea, pinned in the cliffs of an island.

He liked it, liked the way the sea washed the walls of it, taking some chunks of with it in the meanwhile.

Now that is an interesting love story.

He needed it, a princess in his tower, he wanted that, to see her in her flowy dresses, watch her spin, watch her run, listen to her scream, to her chant.

Dragons are not born of an egg, another dragon kills a virgin princess by its fire, and sometimes if theres luck, a new dragon appears. Life is always this kind of weird.

Who knows, maybe he just wanted a mother figure, like the humans have!

He liked the humans, their flaws, their vices, and specially their princesses.

After all he was born from one, and we all know damsels and treasures are a dragon specialty.

He remembered his dad, burning one beautiful, beautiful red haired princess, he remembered the smell of burnted skin, how the dress glued itself to her showing bones, he remembered the smoke, he remembered the scream, the cry, he remembered the feeling he had: mesmerised, hunger, pain, alive, whole, complete, gorgeous.

He also remembered the time his dad died, killed with deafening spear to the heart by a knight when he himself was nothing more then a lizard.

He remembered the princess that was in the castle at that time, her tears, her smile, her songs.

He remembered she liked him she said to him that he looked like a small cute dog.

“What is a dog?” She laughed.

He remembered the flowy dresses she had, the way she carresed his scales, and that she had no fear of him, not like the others.

Now that is a princess worth sailing to an island lost in the sea.

Sometimes it’s hard, to burn a princess, you want to do it, but you also want to see her dance, see her move, you are trully enchanted by her. Some other princesses, well…

He did not want to see that princess burnt alive, her touch, her songs, her dances, her voice, her smile, he understood the knight that came to rescue her, but still he did not wish to see his father die.

There was a huge swoosh sound in the sky, a tower of his castle sinked in the the bottom of the sea.

Now that is an interesting love story! The sea and castle.

He got out of his fortress, beast on the rainy cliffs, stormy sea below his claws.

He opened once again his long, long wings.

He had enough of waiting!

He did not knew what he was about to do, just that it was going to be somehow different.

There was nothing there for him, at least not in that very moment.

Who knew if later.

He wanted a new interesting love story, and now just for him.

He wanted a princess, and he wanted fire!

There was another huge swoosh sound in the sky, and then, there was fire.
