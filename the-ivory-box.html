			    <p class="card-text prep">Boxes are quite tricky and we all have them, somehow, somewhere we all end up accumulating some sort of packages, and each and every one of them has its label, its story.
They come in different sizes, materials, colours.
They come wrapped up, airtight closed, damaged or forgotten.
We all have them and we all have “it”.
Our own box, room 404, but in a smaller version, our own personalized, hyped-up Pandora Box, and we want it as sealed as possible.
            
Mine is an Ivory Box, “easy to pick-up” size, I know it, I have seen it so many times. I feel it glued to different parts of my body changing location from hour to hour.
As when I say “I love you” without knowing the response, I have it clung to my chest.
When I shut up though I want to cuss, it stays on the back of my hips entering my belly from behind.
When I want to embark on a journey and I am frightened it touches every bone of my structure.
            
Sometimes, sometimes, I feel I’m swallowed up inside my own compartmentalised darkness, my demons chewing chunks of my being, casting me in different realms of existence; that moment lingering itself towards eternity.
            
Maybe that is why we want our Pandora Box so sealed up.
That metaphorical package we all bury inside, our shadow, our subconscious; all the junk we create and project on others; all the junk we unconsciously accumulate; all that junk, that weirdly enough was already there, to begin with.
All of these are the engines, the motors, the fuel of our own being and existence.
And here lays the reason, the answer in this need of allowing, this constant curse upon ourselves, the darkness.
                        
Open your Pandora Box! Do it as often as possible! Organize whatever is inside, share its content with others or with the mirror, learn from it, most importantly, learn!
            
Like a gun in the cinematic theory, if it appears on screen, the weapon will fire up.
Pandora boxes are Shadows, Weird Dreams, Desires and Ideas in need to be digested. If not it will be You that ends up in the gutter of your own fears.
You have to know what controls you and gives you power.
Open your Pandora Box!
Find what’s inside there! See it reflected in the world.
            
Mine is an Ivory Box, terrifying, beautiful, graceful, cruel box, most of my stories come from there and that is the reason for sharing these writings, they all come from my Ivory Box.
Boxes are quite tricky and we all have them, somehow, somewhere we all end up accumulating some sort of packages, and each and every one of them has its label, its story, these are mines.</p>

<h1>
The Alchemy of Fire
</h1>

<h6>July 7, 2019</h6>

<p class="user-select-none">
People needed fire, a sacrifice supplier,
Something hate could enquire
So they brought Her to a stake.
Hands tied, head down, eyes closed, lips bleeding, feet rasped on sharp stones, toes broken, arms shaken, soul moving.
“Welcome to your death” said the shaft to her aching palms.
“Welcome to the fire” smoke opened her eyes.
“Welcome to the flame that will be your end” ‘Maidens screams stabbed the air!
Silence. Cheering. Grasping. Swearing. Unease. Pleasure. Whispers
Prayers, to God and Saints no one trusted.
Only Adoration, was hate in exaltation.
Fear blooming, Fear crackling, flesh burning.
Hearts excited, hate as master.
People needed fire, a sacrifice supplier
So they burned their soul to a stake.
That is when love turned into a mistake
And life became simply just an ache
But the witch knew
Fire is like alchemy.
And instead of burning souls for hate, envy and fear.
Better burn fear, envy and hate for soul.
Tough it hurts, tough it burns, tough it aches.
She knew she did not cursed the people, they cursed themselves.
So before disappearing in the light.
She smiled, cause she knew.
Fire was Her destiny.
