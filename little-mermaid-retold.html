                    <p class="card-text prep">This is the true story no one told you. Fairy-Tales are more than mere words put together. Somewhere, somehow, this happened.
You know it so.
You can feel it, that’s why some stories always linger in the perimeter of our knowledge, waiting to be properly retold.
So, we all know the story of the little mermaid, right? Not the Disney sweet version, no, no. The one that Hans Christian Andersen made, more than 100 years ago.

Innocent cute little mermaid falls in love with a human she saves from drowning.
Her animal lust and obsession made her search for information, so she finds it, the path to transformation.
Off she goes to a sea witch because she has a voice to ditch in exchange for some legs, whose feet will bleed at every step those feet will make.
Mind You, she is happy.
She has a prince she fancies, a love story to develop pierced into her scales, for a manly dandy and a life that holds the promise of so much more.

Mermaids, they say, live more than 300 years, then their corpses change into bubbles and cute little sea foam.
They don’t have souls to lose, nor God to pray.



If our innocent, cute little mermaid would not make the manly dandy prince fell for her, or make him wed her, she was to die at 16 mere of age.
And wed her, he did not, though he liked her, liked to see her dance, and dance, her and her bleeding feet. So she danced and dance even more at his wedding feast.
Ceremony he indeed had but with another of his sweethearts.
All the guests cheered joyfully for the newly princess as the feast was made on a royal boat, far away on sea. This sweetheart of his, was the first thing he gazed upon after almost drowning at sea so they called it destiny.

When the manly dandy prince felt asleep, after his wedding night, in his royal bed, in his royal boat, stars were shining in the black pit of the night, their reflections mixing on the sea with the waste of lingering feast.
The little mermaid as a humble guest walked slowly on the deck, awaiting the inevitable.
Then they appeared, a few bald heads emerging from the sea, little mermaids sisters, you see?
They pass her a knife, to kill the prince.

Because they also made a wish with the witch so they could forth-save their own, their family, their sister, their kin.
So she, little mermaid, could own, could gain her old sweet life back.
A life not worth loosing, for a mere God praying animal.


And once again unknowingly the fate of the prince was to be sealed by the heart of a mermaid princess.

Off she went to the prince, knife in her grip hovering over his bed, human wife by his side… and this is where Hans Christian Andersen got it all wrong.

You see mermaids, are not Christian Damsels, they are natures warriors, they are the fantastical, evil, terrifying female unleashed. They come from the belly of the first Hell Goddes, TIAMAT. Mermaids are the women with no excuses, the barbarians of nature, cause the moon controls the bleeding of their unknown heart. Maybe that is why Hans Christian Andersen, killed his mermaid. But it wasn’t her who died, that night, you see?

Not so innocent, though still cute middle age mermaid changed a lot since she killed the prince in his wedding bed more than 100 years ago. Her sisters grew their hair back, but the gifted knife still stayed in her deadly grip and now this mermaid got a taste for men’s blood cause she learnt that a lust for life is the only lust worth having.
